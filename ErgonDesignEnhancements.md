## Implementation Considerations

When implementing these enhancements, the following principles should be maintained:

1. **Modularity**: Each enhancement should be implemented as a discrete module
2. **CLI-First**: Maintain the command-line interface as the primary integration point
3. **Performance**: Ensure enhancements don't degrade system performance
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve compatibility with existing components

## Prioritization Framework

Enhancements should be prioritized based on:

1. **Value**: Impact on overall system capabilities
2. **Complexity**: Implementation difficulty and resources required
3. **Dependencies**: Reliance on other enhancements or systems
4. **User Demand**: Frequency of feature requests from users

## Next Steps

1. Implement core Ergon functionality
2. Gather usage data to inform enhancement priorities
3. Create detailed specifications for high-priority enhancements
4. Develop enhancement roadmap with timelines
5. Implement enhancements in prioritized order
