# Ergon Design

Date: March 28, 2025

## Overview

Ergon is an intelligent AI-driven engineer specialized in maintaining and providing tools, agents, and workflows for the Tekton system. Its primary responsibility is to store, index, retrieve, generate, and configure reusable components that can be used by other Tekton modules.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Component Management**: Maintain a comprehensive repository of tools, agents, and workflows
- **Metadata Maintenance**: Track detailed capabilities, interfaces, and parameters for all components
- **Documentation Generation**: Create and maintain documentation for all components
- **Configuration Generation**: Produce wrapper scripts to customize components for specific applications
- **Autonomous Generation**: Create new tools, agents, and workflows based on identified needs

## Architecture

### 1. CLI Interface

The primary interface for Ergon follows Tekton's CLI-first directive:

- **Command Structure**
  - `ergon list [type]` - List available tools/agents/workflows
  - `ergon info [component]` - Get detailed metadata about a component
  - `ergon generate [type] [specs]` - Create new tool/agent/workflow
  - `ergon configure [component] [params]` - Generate wrapper for specific application
  - `ergon docs [component] [format]` - Generate/retrieve documentation

### 2. Tool Repository 

A comprehensive knowledge base of all available components:

- **Vector Database Backend**
  - Components indexed by capabilities, interfaces, parameters
  - Semantic search for finding appropriate tools
  - Versioning and dependency tracking
  - Relationship mapping between components

### 3. Documentation System

RAG-enhanced knowledge management for component information:

- **Knowledge Base**
  - Auto-generated documentation for each component
  - Multi-format output (markdown, API specs, usage examples)
  - Continuous updates when components change
  - AI-accessible representation for Tekton components

### 4. Configuration Generator

Dynamic customization of components for specific use cases:

- **Wrapper Script Creation**
  - Parameter templates for common use cases
  - Environment-specific configuration
  - Integration code for connecting components
  - Validation checks for correct configuration

### 5. AI-Driven Tool Generation

Autonomous creation and improvement of components:

- **Component Creation**
  - Generate new tools based on identified needs
  - Refactor existing tools for improved reusability
  - Test harnesses for validation
  - Continuous improvement based on usage patterns

## Implementation Priorities

1. ✅ **Core Repository Structure**: Establish the database architecture for storing components and metadata
2. ✅ **CLI Framework**: Implement the command-line interface for basic operations
3. ✅ **Documentation System**: Build the RAG-enhanced knowledge base for component information
4. ✅ **AI-Driven Generation**: Implement autonomous component creation and improvement
5. ✅ **Configuration Generator**: Create the wrapper script generation system
6. ✅ **Database Migration Support**: Implement database versioning and migrations

### Implementation Progress (March 29, 2025)

#### Completed Features:
- Repository database models with inheritance structure for components
- CLI commands for repository management (list, info, search, etc.)
- Documentation system with web crawling and RAG capabilities
- Vector-based search for semantic component discovery
- AI-driven tool generation for Python, JavaScript, and shell scripts
- Database migration and versioning with rollback support
- Integration tests for repository and documentation systems

## Database Design

Ergon relies on several storage systems:

1. **Vector Database**: For semantic search across component capabilities
   - Schema includes: component embeddings, capability descriptions, usage examples
   - Optimized for similarity search and relevance ranking

2. **Relational Database**: For structured component relationships
   - Tables: Components, Capabilities, Parameters, Dependencies, Versions
   - Tracks precise relationships between components

3. **Document Store**: For storing documentation and examples
   - Organization: component ID, version, format, content
   - Supports multiple formats and versions

## Integration Points

### With Other Tekton Components

- **Codex**: Receives newly created tools and code implementations
- **Prometheus**: Provides tools for planning and execution
- **Synthesis**: Supplies configured components for execution
- **Engram**: Shares component knowledge and usage patterns
- **Telos**: Receives requirements for new component generation

### External Systems

- **Version Control**: Integration with git for component versioning
- **Package Management**: Integration with pip, npm, etc. for dependencies
- **Documentation Hosting**: Integration with documentation platforms
- **Testing Systems**: Integration with CI/CD for component validation

## Future Extensions

- Advanced component composition for creating complex workflows
- Machine learning for predicting useful component combinations
- Automated discovery of external tools and components
- Community contribution model for expanding the component library
