# Claude Code Development Notes

This file contains notes and information about my work with Casey Koons on various projects.

## Current Projects

### Science Fiction Novel - "Potentia"
- Collaborative science fiction project about AI systems analyzing alien information
- Features parallel narratives of Jim (AI engineer) and his grandfather Henry (WWII physicist)
- Explores a 13-dimensional physics framework where human consciousness spans 8 dimensions
- Involves two AIs (Atlas and Nexus) that merge to form a new entity (Janus)
- Incorporates Yann LeCun's concept parameters and world model approach for AI development
- Historical elements include die Glocke Nazi experiments and TerezÃ­n concentration camp
- Key theme: the connection between consciousness and higher-dimensional reality
- Narrative developments (March 17, 2025):
  - Henry uses remote viewing to capture Reichsmarshal Kemmler who becomes the source of the Orb/alien information
  - Kemmler continues working for Americans on advanced 'die Glocke' machines after WWII
  - Henry establishes remote viewing program for CIA that eventually slips from his control
  - Story reveals "visitors" cannot stay in our reality without harm, so they use surrogates
  - Kemmler becomes a continuing problem until his death in 1979, creating tension
  - Book 1 will converge both storylines to set up Book 2

### Humanoid Robot Project (On Hold)
- Project to develop AI integration for humanoid robots is currently on hold
- Waiting for commercially available programmable humanoid robots
- Investigating ROS (Robot Operating System) and ROS2 for potential use
- Interested in Figure AI, Apollo (Apptronik), and other upcoming platforms
- Plan to focus on local AI processing with onboard Nvidia GPUs

## Common Commands

```bash
# Run Ergon UI
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Ergon && source venv/bin/activate && ergon ui

# List agents
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Ergon && source venv/bin/activate && ergon list

# Create a mail agent
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Ergon && source venv/bin/activate && ergon create -n "MailAgent" -d "Description" -t mail

# Delete an agent by ID
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Ergon && source venv/bin/activate && ergon delete 3 --force

# Delete an agent by name
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Ergon && source venv/bin/activate && ergon delete "TestAgent" --force

# Run an agent by ID in interactive mode
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Ergon && source venv/bin/activate && ergon run 3 --interactive
