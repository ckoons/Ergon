```

> **Note for Apple Silicon Mac users**: Be sure to include the `--platform linux/arm64` flag when building and running Docker images to ensure compatibility.

### Documentation Preloading

Ergon offers built-in documentation preloading to enhance agent capabilities. There are several ways to preload documentation:

1. **Via the UI (Recommended)**: 
   Navigate to the Documentation or Web Search pages in the UI. If no documentation is found, you'll see a "Preload Essential Documentation" button that will automatically crawl and index documentation from Pydantic, LangChain, LangGraph, and Anthropic.

2. **Using the CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Preload all documentation sources
   ergon preload-docs

   # Preload a specific source
   ergon preload-docs --source pydantic
   ergon preload-docs --source langchain
   ergon preload-docs --source langgraph
   ergon preload-docs --source anthropic

   # Customize crawling settings
   ergon preload-docs --max-pages 500 --max-depth 4 --timeout 300
   ```

3. **With Docker**:
   ```bash
   # Preload all documentation sources
   docker run --platform linux/arm64 ergon preload-docs  # For Apple Silicon Macs
   docker run --platform linux/amd64 ergon preload-docs  # For Intel/AMD systems

   # Preload a specific source
   docker run --platform linux/arm64 ergon preload-docs --source langchain  # For Apple Silicon
   docker run --platform linux/arm64 ergon preload-docs --source langgraph  # For Apple Silicon
   ```

The preloaded documentation enables agents to leverage knowledge from these frameworks when responding to queries, making them more effective for framework-specific tasks.

Ergon automatically caches documentation for faster preloading in future sessions. Cached documentation is stored in the `vector_store/doc_cache` directory and is valid for 7 days, after which it will be refreshed automatically. This ensures your documentation stays current while minimizing network usage.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- No external services required (uses SQLite by default)
- LLM API key (supports Claude, OpenAI, or local models via Ollama)

## UI Overview

The Ergon UI is designed to be intuitive and streamlined:

- **Nexus**: Memory-enabled AI assistant for finding and using agents
- **My Agents**: Browse, organize, and manage your created agents
- **Create Agent**: Form to create new agents with different capabilities
- **Documentation**: Preload, search, and manage documentation resources

## Architecture

Ergon consists of several core components:

1. **Core Engine**: Agent generation and execution logic
2. **Local Database**: SQLite-based storage for agents and sessions
3. **Vector Store**: FAISS-based document embedding and retrieval
4. **UI**: Streamlit-based web interface 
5. **CLI**: Command-line interface for automation and scripting
6. **API**: REST API for integration with other tools
7. **Documentation Crawler**: Tools for indexing documentation

## Configuration

Ergon uses a hierarchical configuration system with environment variables loaded from multiple files in the following priority order:

1. `.env.owner`: Highest priority, personal settings not checked into version control
2. `.env.local`: Middle priority, machine-specific settings not checked into version control 
3. `.env`: Lowest priority, base configuration shared by all users

Values in earlier files override those in later files. All files are loaded, creating a cascading configuration system.

### Authentication Configuration

Ergon includes a configurable authentication system controlled via the `ERGON_AUTHENTICATION` environment variable:

- `ERGON_AUTHENTICATION=true` (default): User authentication is required
- `ERGON_AUTHENTICATION=false`: Authentication is bypassed (useful for testing)

You can set this variable in any of the environment files or on the command line:

```bash
# Run with authentication disabled
ERGON_AUTHENTICATION=false ergon ui

# Run tests without authentication prompts
ERGON_AUTHENTICATION=false pytest tests/
```

Example configuration:

```bash
# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434"

# Model settings
DEFAULT_MODEL="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"
USE_LOCAL_MODELS=false
EMBEDDING_MODEL="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

# Authentication settings
ERGON_AUTHENTICATION=true  # Set to false to disable authentication

# Application settings
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
DEBUG=false
```

## Working with Agents

Ergon provides a unified interface for creating, running, and managing AI agents through both the CLI and web UI.

### Creating Agents

```bash
# Create a standard agent
ergon create -n "MyAgent" -d "Description of the agent" -t standard

# Create a GitHub agent
ergon create -n "GitHubAgent" -d "GitHub repository manager" -t github

# Create a Mail agent
ergon create -n "MailAgent" -d "Email management assistant" -t mail
```

### Running Agents

There are several ways to run your agents:

```bash
# List available agents
ergon list

# Run an agent by ID
ergon run 3 -i "Your input here"

# Run an agent by name (more human-friendly)
ergon run "MyAgent" -i "Your input here"

# Run an agent in interactive mode (conversation)
ergon run "MyAgent" --interactive

# Run an agent with a timeout (30 seconds)
ergon run "GitHubAgent" -i "Your input here" --timeout 30

# Set timeout action (log, alarm, or kill)
ergon run "MailAgent" -i "Your input here" --timeout 30 --timeout-action alarm
```

### Agent Timeout Management

Ergon provides built-in timeout functionality to monitor and control agent executions:

#### Timeout Options

- `--timeout <seconds>`: Set a maximum execution time in seconds
- `--timeout-action <action>`: Specify what happens when timeout occurs:
  - `log`: Record timeout in logs and return a gentle message (default)
  - `alarm`: Record timeout and return a more prominent warning message
  - `kill`: Terminate the agent execution and return an error message

#### Use Cases

- **Resource Management**: Prevent runaway agents from consuming excessive resources
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track how long agents take to complete tasks
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Ensure batch operations complete within time constraints
- **Production Reliability**: Implement circuit breakers for mission-critical agent tasks

#### Examples

```bash
# Set a 30-second timeout with default "log" action
ergon run "ResearchAgent" -i "Research quantum computing" --timeout 30

# Use "alarm" action to get a more noticeable timeout warning
ergon run "DataAgent" -i "Analyze this dataset" --timeout 60 --timeout-action alarm

# Use "kill" action to forcibly terminate long-running operations
ergon run "ComplexAgent" -i "Complex task" --timeout 120 --timeout-action kill
```

### Managing Agents

You can manage your agents with the following commands:

```bash
# List all agents
ergon list

# Delete an agent by ID (with confirmation prompt)
ergon delete 3

# Delete an agent by name (with confirmation prompt)
ergon delete "TestAgent"

# Force delete an agent without confirmation
ergon delete "MyAgent" --force
```

### Using the Nexus Interface

You can launch the Nexus interface to interact with your agents in an intuitive, conversation-driven experience:

```bash
# Start the UI (using the convenience script for cleaner output)
./run_chatbot

# Or use the standard command
ergon ui
```

The Nexus interface provides several ways to work with agents:

#### Conversational Agent Usage

1. Simply ask Nexus about your task or what you need help with
2. Nexus will recommend appropriate agents based on your request
3. Select the recommended agent from the sidebar
4. Continue your conversation with the selected agent

#### Memory-Enabled Experience

Ergon's Nexus features enhanced memory capabilities through its integrated memory system:

```bash
# Create a new memory-enabled Nexus agent
ergon create -n "MemoryAgent" -d "Agent with enhanced memory capabilities" -t nexus

# Chat with the memory agent in interactive mode
ergon nexus "MemoryAgent" --interactive

# Single request with memory
ergon nexus "MemoryAgent" -i "Hello, do you remember me?"

# Disable memory for a specific interaction
ergon nexus "MemoryAgent" -i "This is a private question" --no-memory
```

The Nexus memory system offers:

- **Persistent Memory**: Information is remembered across different sessions
- **Category Organization**: Memories are organized by category (personal, projects, facts, etc.)
- **Importance Ranking**: 1-5 scoring system prioritizes critical information
- **Auto-categorization**: Content is automatically analyzed to determine category and importance
- **Rich Storage & Retrieval**: Optimized memory storage with tagging and metadata

### Memory System

Ergon includes a powerful, hardware-optimized memory system built on Tekton's shared vector database architecture. The memory system is accessible through both the CLI and the API.

```bash
# List memories for an agent
ergon memory list "MyAgent"

# Search agent memories
ergon memory search "MyAgent" "query text" --category personal --min-importance 3

# Add a new memory
ergon memory add "MyAgent" "User prefers dark mode interfaces" --category preference --importance 4

# Delete a memory
ergon memory delete "MyAgent" memory_id --force

# Clear memories in a category
ergon memory clear "MyAgent" --category session --force

# List available memory categories
ergon memory categories
```

The memory system features:

- **Hardware-Optimized Storage**: Automatically selects the optimal vector database implementation based on hardware (Qdrant for Apple Silicon, FAISS for NVIDIA)
- **Structured Categories**: Organizes memories into categories (personal, factual, preference, etc.)
- **Importance Ranking**: 1-5 importance scoring for prioritization
- **Semantic Search**: Fast vector-based retrieval of relevant memories
- **Auto-Categorization**: Automatic detection of appropriate categories and importance levels
- **Shared Database Architecture**: Uses Tekton's shared database approach for optimal performance across components

The memory system is accessible from your own code via the Ergon API:

```python
from ergon.core.memory import MemoryService, RAGService

# Initialize memory service
memory_service = MemoryService(agent_id=42)
await memory_service.initialize()

# Store a memory
memory_id = await memory_service.add_memory(
    content="User prefers dark mode interfaces",
    category="preference",
    importance=4
)

# Retrieve relevant memories
context = await memory_service.get_relevant_context(
    query="What UI theme does the user prefer?",
    min_importance=3
)

# Use the RAG service to enhance prompts
rag = RAGService(agent_id=42)
enhanced_prompt = await rag.augment_prompt(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    user_query="What theme should I use?"
)
```

The system works automatically when properly configured, providing a consistent experience across all Ergon components.
