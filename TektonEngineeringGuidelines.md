# Tekton Engineering Guidelines

This document outlines the engineering principles and practices for the Tekton ecosystem.

## Core Principles

- **Modularity**: All Tekton components should be modular and follow well-defined interfaces.
- **Interoperability**: Components should work together seamlessly while maintaining independence.
- **Performance Optimization**: Code should be optimized for the hardware it runs on.
- **User Experience**: APIs and interfaces should be intuitive and consistent.

## Data Storage Architecture

- **Shared Resource Approach**:
  - All databases used by Tekton components MUST be shared resources for the set of components
  - Hardware-optimized implementations (e.g., Qdrant for Apple Silicon, FAISS for NVIDIA)
  - Automatic database selection based on hardware detection
  - Common data directory structure (`~/.tekton/`)
  - Environment variables for overriding default paths

- **Client Database Options**:
  - Agents, tools, and workflows can choose their database strategy:
    1. Generate standalone database instances when isolation is required
    2. Use existing system databases when available and appropriate
    3. Use Tekton shared databases when performance and integration are priorities

## Development Practices

- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control with meaningful commit messages.
- **Documentation**: All code should be well-documented with docstrings and READMEs.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all code with CI/CD integration.
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes should be reviewed by at least one other developer.

## Coding Standards

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 style guide with type hints.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
- **Error Handling**: Use proper error handling with meaningful error messages.
- **Logging**: Include appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring.

## Security Practices

- **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication for all user-facing interfaces.
- **Authorization**: Enforce proper access controls to protect sensitive data.
- **Data Security**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
